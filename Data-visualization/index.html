            Following the EU referendum, the value of sterling fell sharply against the dollar at the end of June and
            into July. In July 2016,the sterling Exchange Rate Index (ERI) was 15% lower compared with July 2015 and 6.6% lower compared with
            the average level in June 2016.
            In August 2016 and September 2016, the exchange rate showed some signs of increasing, however the value of
            sterling fell continued decreasing after September 2016.
        </br></br>
            Figure 1 shows British Pound (GBP) to US Dollar (USD) exchange rate from 01/01/2014 to 31/10/2016. This
            indicates that the pound has fallen against the dollar, following
            the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
            The falling pound leads to the import price increasing.

            Consumer price inflation is the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households fall or
            rise.
            Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices.
            The easy way to understand this is to assume that a very large shopping basket contains all the goods and
            services bought by households,and movements in price index represent the changing cost of this basket. </br>

            </br>The price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common way is to find
            how the index has changed over a year. To calculate price index, comparing the price index for the latest
            month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. </br>

            </br>The CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation created to international standards. Figure shows UK's
            CPI 12-month inflation rate from January 2014 to October 2016.
            It shows that consumer price inflation suddenly rose in September. The annual rate of CPI inflation was 1
            per cent, up from 0.6 per cent in July

<p>This figure shows the index of import price from May 2014 to October 2016 compared with that of in 2013 and the standard in 2013 is 100. Then index of import price
shows a slight fluctuate before referendum and it average at 90.7 in the fist 6 month of 2016.Then it rise up considerably after referendum to 95.2 in July 2016. The 
data is trend to stable in the next 3 months from July to September and then experience a dramatic growth to 97. 8. 
<br />

</br>Compared with the exchange rate between the pound to dollar, we can find that the trend form this two graph show a crosscurrent. In the fist month of referendum,
the Sterling exchange rate shapely decrease and the import price shapely increase. In the July, August and September, the Sterling exchange rate tends to be stable and 
the import price shows the same tendency. Then the October saw a dramatic drop while the import price keep an upward tendency. Thus the referendum influences the import 
price through the Sterling exchange rate. After referendum, the Sterling exchange rate going down and the import price show a rise trend.
